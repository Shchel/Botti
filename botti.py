Have you heard of sepak takraw? It‚Äôs a sport in Southeast Asia which *( PLAY )* like volleyball, except players use their feet to kick the ball and not their hands.

The sport has been around since the 15th century, with records *( SHOW )* that it was played by one of the royal families of the Malay region at that time.

The word ‚Äòsepak‚Äô is Malay for ‚Äòkick‚Äô and ‚Äòtakraw‚Äô is Thai for ‚Äòwoven ball‚Äô; thus, the name of the sport literally means ‚Äòkick ball‚Äô. The combination of these words from different languages represents a symbol of solidarity between two of the *( POWERFUL )* countries in the region.

My job would probably rank as one of the most *( POPULAR )* but I really like it. I am an accountant and I work from 9 am until 6 pm (although it takes an hour by train to reach my office in The City).

People think that accountancy involves working all day long with numbers and that it is really boring. But they could not be more wrong. My work is exciting, challenging, varied and both personally and professionally rewarding. Being involved with the *( COMMERCE )* world is also, at times, really good fun.

I deal mainly with new, start-up businesses and typically I see about three clients *( DAY )*. Either I go out to their offices or they visit me and I often have lunch with a client. Over the years some of them have become friends and I know their wives and families.

The main task is to check their financial figures are correct and it is true that this part is tough work. But in *( ADD )* my job is to advise and help them.

Many new businesses have a rather *( ANXIETY )* time trying to build up customers and make profits. They are encouraged and even relieved when I explain to them that it is not normal to make profits immediately. It can take years before a business is functioning correctly.

Probably my biggest contribution is to advise them of the most efficient way to invest in their businesses.

Very often, a small change can make a big *( DIFFER )* in business. When they take my advice and I see a new company or business begin to succeed ‚Äî it is really satisfying. I feel as if I was part of the success story and a member of their team.

It‚Äôs a wonderful new way of communicating! E-mail is cheaper than normal mail and even if you send your message *abroad / away / aside / alive* it only costs the same as a local telephone call. This is because your message
goes to computer called a mail server and then it is *traffic / translated / transmitted / transferred* across the Net via other mail servers to its destination.
E-mail is also much quicker and can arrive at most destinations in a minute. In fact, ordinary mail is so slow by comparison that Net users call it ‚Äòsnail mail‚Äô.
With e-mail you also have to know someone‚Äôs address and everyone on the Net has their own *people / personal / individual / men‚Äôs* e-mail address. An e-mail address has two main sections: the user‚Äôs name and the domain name. The user‚Äôs name is usually the name or nickname of the person using e-mail, for example ‚ÄòPaul‚Äô. This is *followed / gone / set / got* by the symbol @ which means ‚Äòat‚Äô. Then there is the domain name which gives information about the computer, for example ‚Äòhome‚Äô, the type of *scope / form / organisation / way* , for example ‚Äòcom‚Äô, means a commercial and its location. So a complete e-mail address might look something like this: Paul@home.com.uk.
E-mail addresses can be *difficult / easy / simple / complicated* so write them down carefully. Then you will have the address at the top of their message and you can just press ‚Äòreply‚Äô.''',

Globalization, as a general term, is best understood as the spread of ideas about the environment, democracy, human rights, and less complicated issues like fashion and fads.

The nature of business and how it is done has also improved by *BONDS / GAPS / JUMPS / LEAPS* and bounds because of globalization.


An example of the remarkable effects of globalization is the invention of the telephone and the television. Television has enabled young people and adults to have the ability to share cultural and ethnic experiences with others. Telephones have also greatly improved communication. Gone are the weeks and even months of waiting for a letter. Anybody can talk to anyone who has another phone *REGARDLESS / DESPITE / NOTWITHSTANDING / BECAUSE* of distance or location on the planet.

About forty years ago I was an instructor in the military academy at Woolwich.

I was touched to the quick with pity because the rest of the class answered up brightly and handsomely while he didn‚Äôt know anything, so to speak. All the compassion in me was aroused in his behalf. I understood that when he came to be examined again, he would be flung over, so it would be simply a harmless act of *CHARITY / CRUELTY / LOYALTY / BRAVERY* to ease his fall as much as I could.

I took him aside, and found that he knew a little of Caesar‚Äôs history; and as he didn‚Äôt know anything else, I went to work and drilled him like a galley slave on a certain line of stock questions concerning Caesar which I knew would be used. You won‚Äôt believe me but he went through with flying *MARKS / GRADES / COLOURS / BANNERS* on examination day! He went through on that purely superficial ‚Äòcram,‚Äô and got compliments too, while others, who knew a thousand times more than he, got plucked. *UNDER / IN / WITH / BY* some strangely lucky accident, he was asked no question outside of the narrow limits of his drill.

It was stupefying. Now of course the thing that would *FIND / EXPOSE / DENOUNCE / INJURE* him and kill him at last was mathematics. I *SUGGESTED / SETTLED / SOLVED / RESOLVED* to make his death as easy as I could. So I drilled him and crammed him just on the line of questions which the examiners would be most likely to use, and then launched him on his fate. Well, try to *CONCEIVE / IMAGINE / PREDICT / FORTELL* of the result: to my consternation, he took the first prize! And with it he got a perfect ovation in the way of compliments.

And that's putting it *MILD / MILDER / MILDEST / MILDLY*.To be fair, there were people who said at the time that there was nothing wrong in wearing a glove puppet to a Board meeting. However, there were more who disagreed, and several who thought that Mr. Ramsay was off his chump. The matter was hotly disputed in the company's offices, on the shop floor, in the canteen.

It happened during Mr. Giles's monthly overlong summary of the company's financial position. Two factors were making the prospects for Ramsay & Co look bleak.

The first of these factors spoke for itself. There were simply fewer items of hosiery being sold. Whether this was due to the long hot summer combined with the undoubted increase *AT / IN / OF / TO* the uptake of feminine trousers, or it was a sign of continued recession was not for him to say. Ramsay & Co simply had to *COMMENT / COPE / DEAL / FACE* the facts, whether they liked them or not, and accept what the market was telling them. Reality didn't always turn *IN / ON / OUT / UP* the way people wanted it to.

The second factor, however, was where they could do something about. Ramsay & Co's costs were inordinately high compared to those of its competitors, who had been cutting back on staff over the last five years, reducing their workforce to one-fifth of its previous level. It was high *PRICE / MOMENT / TIME / WAY* that Ramsay & Co got itself into a similar position.

None of the Board members was surprised at what Mr. Giles had to say. He had, after all, said it all before, many times, over the past several months. Mr. Ramsay had, until now, always stubbornly resisted him. This time, though, what happened was different from all the previous occasions. Mr. Ramsay had never before produced a glove puppet from underneath the table. He had never had a squirrel sitting on his left hand during a presentation.

The only two pairs of eyes in the room focused on Mr. Giles during his summation of the company's position were those of Mr. Ramsay and the squirrel, both of whom were shaking their heads very slightly. The other Board members were sitting shocked with their mouths wide open and were *WATCHING / STARING / SEEING / OBSERVING* at the puppet.
